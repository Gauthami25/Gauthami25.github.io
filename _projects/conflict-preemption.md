## Project Overview

ðŸ“Œ The primary objective of this project is to establish a framework for real-time predictive analytics for the efficient provisioning of cloud resources. 

ðŸ“Œ This framework is intended to assist organizations in transitioning towards a machine learning-based approach for resource provisioning, usage tracking, with a focus on making real-time predictions, automating resource scheduling.

ðŸ“Œ This shift is essential due to the considerable manual effort currently required for setting resource limits  provisioning, as companies grapple with the challenge of balancing cost minimization ensuring system uptime  availability.

ðŸ“Œ I leveraged the Grid Workloads Archive dataset, which contains valuable performance metrics from virtual machines in a distributed datacenter managed by Bitbrains. I worked on the development of a predictive model designed to offer more intelligent resource usage forecasts. This process involved a multifaceted approach, including time-series analysis, advanced regression techniques,  time series with cross-validation to characterize resource usage patterns and identify key predictive features.

ðŸ“Œ I harnessed the power of DeepAR on the AWS platform to enable real-time analytics, enhancing the capabilities of this framework.

Conclusion: The average CPU usage is only about 7% of what was being provisioned

## Solution: Predictive Scheduling and provisioning of resources
