## Project Overview

ðŸ“Œ In this project, I delved into the world of CAPTCHAs, aiming to uncover their susceptibilities to automated bot detection using advanced deep-learning techniques. 

ðŸ“Œ To address CAPTCHA security, I harnessed the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to craft CAPTCHAs that posed a significantly greater challenge for bot detection. Drawing inspiration from the Street View House Numbers dataset (SVHN dataset), my goal was to simplify the CAPTCHA creation process.

## Approach
ðŸ“Œ This comprised of the generator network that took random noise as input, producing images that closely resembled those from the SVHN dataset. On the flip side, the discriminator was a standard binary classification convolutional neural network, adept at distinguishing between images generated by the GAN (classified as fake) and genuine SVHN dataset images (classified as real). This dynamic interplay between generator and discriminator formed the core of my approach to creating more robust CAPTCHAs.
