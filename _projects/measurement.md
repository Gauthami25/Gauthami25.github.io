# Project Overview

ðŸ“Œ In this project, I conducted an analysis of structured and semi-structured data derived from YouTube videos after setting up the necessary data infrastructure

ðŸ“Œ My goals were to streamline data ingestion, implement an ETL system that handle handle diverse data sources, establish a centralized data lake, ensure scalability, and leverage AWS for real time processing.

ðŸ“Œ Scalability was a critical consideration as it was important to ensure the system could effectively manage increased data volume. Given the scale of data processing required, integration with AWS was essential, with services such as Amazon S3 for scalable object storage, AWS IAM for secure resource management, QuickSight for cloud-based, machine-learning-powered business intelligence reporting, AWS Glue for serverless data integration, AWS Lambda for serverless code execution, and AWS Athena for interactive query capabilities on data stored in S3.

ðŸ“Œ The dataset comprised of CSV and JSON files with statistics on daily popular YouTube videos.
