Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning, data engineering, Python and SQL skills to drive innovative solutions for businesses and society. 
Growing up, I have been a bit of a wanderer within India. I've bounced around different states in India, and experienced the fast pace of Mumbai, the historical charm of Delhi, and the vibrant tech scene of Bangalore. My journey didn't stop there. I ventured across the oceans to pursue my masters in the United States. It's been an exhilarating ride and now I am a proud graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder with a shiny new Master's in Data Science.
I've had the privilege of experiencing both industry and academia. It's been a whirlwind adventure, and I'm just getting started.
When I'm not wrangling data or diving into code, I'm out exploring the outdoors. Nature's my sanctuary, and I'm always up for a hike or a leisurely stroll. And if you see me trying to convince a squirrel to join my team, don't be surprised - they've got mad debugging skills.

When it comes rejuvenating myself, Badminton is my game of choice, a perfect blend of strategy and sweat. It's my go-to for blowing off steam and staying on top of my game.

Life lesson I come to time and again: The fun's in the journey, not just the destination.

<!-- I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org). -->
