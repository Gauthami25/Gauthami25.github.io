👩‍💻 Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning, data engineering, Python and SQL skills to drive innovative solutions for businesses and society. 

🌎 Growing up, I have been a bit of a wanderer within India. I've bounced around different states in India, and experienced the fast pace of Mumbai, the historical charm of Delhi, and the vibrant tech scene of Bangalore. My journey didn't stop there. I ventured across the oceans to pursue my masters in the United States. 

👩‍🎓 It's been an exhilarating ride and now I am a proud graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder with a shiny new Master's in Data Science.

💻 I've had the privilege of experiencing both industry and academia. It's been a whirlwind adventure, and I'm just getting started.

🌳 When I'm not wrangling data or diving into code, I'm out exploring the outdoors. Nature's my sanctuary, and I'm always up for a hike or a leisurely stroll. And if you see me trying to convince a squirrel to join my team, don't be surprised - they've got mad debugging skills.
When it comes rejuvenating myself, Badminton is my game of choice, a perfect blend of strategy and sweat. It's my go-to for blowing off steam and staying on top of my game.

⭐ Life lesson I come to time and again: The fun's in the journey, not just the destination.
